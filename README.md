Let me know if you'd like:

- A **custom UMich-style logo** for MChat (I can generate one for you).
- Embedded YouTube demo markdown if you're hosting it there.
- The `Cargo.toml` file and module layout to match this documentation.

Would you like me to generate a clean **UMich-themed logo** with a chat bubble and "MChat" branding for you now?
